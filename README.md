# TRN-pytorch-Temporal-Relational-Reasoning-in-Videos
### Introduction  
Implementation for Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos. This is a NYU course project for DS-GA 3001.004/.005 Introduction to Computer Vision (Spring 2021)  
In this project, I will implement two models: (1) Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition and Description; (2) Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos. The report will concentrate in discussing MIT CSAIL's creative work: Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos.  


### Data preparation  

For this implementation, we only test one dataset from Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos: Jester. The link of the dataset is here:  [Jester](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester) If you can not download the dataset due to web problems, I suggest you download it from kaggle. Here is the link: [kaggle-jester1](https://www.kaggle.com/zhaochengdu1998/jester1) [kaggle-jester2](https://www.kaggle.com/zhaochengdu1998/jester2)
