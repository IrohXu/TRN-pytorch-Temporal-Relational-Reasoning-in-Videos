# TRN-pytorch-Temporal-Relational-Reasoning-in-Videos
### Introduction  
Implementation for Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos. This is a NYU course project for DS-GA 3001.004/.005 Introduction to Computer Vision (Spring 2021)



### Data preparation  

For this implementation, we only test one dataset from Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos: Jester. The link of the dataset is here:  [Jester](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester)
